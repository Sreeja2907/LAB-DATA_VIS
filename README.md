# Clinical Lab Data Visualization Tool

## Project Overview
This project is about turning lab data (like cholesterol or glucose values) into graphs.  
Usually lab results are shown in tables, but it is difficult to see if the values are going up or down.  
This tool reads a CSV file and shows the results in a chart. Abnormal values are highlighted.

## Features
- Load lab results from CSV file  
- Plot line graph for a selected test  
- Show normal range as shaded area  
- Highlight out-of-range values  
- Save chart as image  

## Tools Used
- Python  
- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- (optional) Streamlit for interface  

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository  
2. Install required packages  
3. Run the Python script to generate charts
